# Prerequisites

## :woman\_technologist:Skills for operating an staking node

As a validator for Ethereum, you will typically have the following abilities:

* operational knowledge of how to set up, run and maintain a Ethereum consensus client, execution client and validator continuously
* a long term commitment to maintain your validator 24/7/365
* basic operating system skills

## :man\_technologist: Experience required to be a successful ETH Staker

* have learned the essentials by watching ['Intro to Eth2 & Staking for Beginners' by Superphiz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkpW031RCI)
* have passed or is actively enrolled in the [Eth2 Study Master course](https://ethereumstudymaster.com)
* and have read the [8 Things Every Eth2 validator should know.](https://medium.com/chainsafe-systems/8-things-every-eth2-validator-should-know-before-staking-94df41701487)

:sparkles: **Pro Validator Tip**: Highly recommend you begin with a brand new instance of an OS, VM, and/or machine. Avoid headaches by NOT reusing testnet keys, wallets, or databases for your validator.

## :tools: Setup Ubuntu

If you need to install Ubuntu Server, refer to [this guide.](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-server#1-overview)

Or Ubuntu Desktop, refer to [this guide.](https://www.coincashew.com/coins/overview-xtz/guide-how-to-setup-a-baker/install-ubuntu)

## :performing\_arts: Setup Metamask

If you need to install Metamask, refer to [this guide.](https://www.coincashew.com/wallets/browser-wallets/metamask-ethereum)

## :jigsaw: High Level Validator Node Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
At the end of this guide, you will build a node that hosts three main components in two layers: consensus layer consists of a consensus client, also known as a validator client with a beacon chain client. The execution layer consists of a execution client, formerly a eth1 node.

**Validator client** - Responsible for producing new blocks and attestations in the beacon chain and shard chains.

**Beacon chain client** - Responsible for managing the state of the beacon chain, validator shuffling, and more.

**Execution client (aka Eth1 node)** - Supplies incoming validator deposits from the eth mainnet chain to the beacon chain client.
