# üòÅ Geth - Enabling path-based storage

{% hint style="info" %}
As of [Geth v1.13.0](https://blog.ethereum.org/2023/09/12/geth-v1-13-0), a new database model for storing the Ethereum state, which is both faster than the previous scheme, and also has proper pruning implemented.&#x20;



No more junk accumulating on disk and no more guerilla (offline) pruning!
{% endhint %}

### :tada: Enjoy performance improvements
