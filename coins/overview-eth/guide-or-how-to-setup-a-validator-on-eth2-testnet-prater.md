## ‚Äã‚Äã:checkered\_flag: 0. Prerequisites <a href="#0.-prerequisites" id="0.-prerequisites"></a>

### :woman\_technologist:Skills to be a eth staker

As a eth staker, you will typically have the following abilities:

* operational knowledge of how to set up, run and maintain a eth beacon node and validator continuously
* a long term commitment to maintain your validator 24/7/365
* basic operating system skills

### :man\_technologist: Experience required to be a successful validator

* have learned the essentials by watching ['Intro to Eth2 & Staking for Beginners' by Superphiz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkpW031RCI)
* have passed or is actively enrolled in the [Eth2 Study Master course](https://ethereumstudymaster.com)
* and have read the [8 Things Every Eth2 validator should know.](https://medium.com/chainsafe-systems/8-things-every-eth2-validator-should-know-before-staking-94df41701487)

### :man\_lifting\_weights: Recommended Hardware Setup

* **Operating system:** 64-bit Linux (i.e. Ubuntu 22.0x+ LTS Server or Desktop)
* **Processor:** Quad core CPU, Intel Core i7‚Äì4770 or AMD FX-8310 or better
* **Memory:** 16GB RAM or more
* **Storage:** 2TB SSD or more

{% hint style="info" %}
:bulb: For examples of actual staking hardware builds, check out [RocketPool's hardware guide](https://github.com/rocket-pool/docs.rocketpool.net/blob/main/src/guides/node/local/hardware.md).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
:sparkles: **Pro Validator Tip**: Highly recommend you begin with a brand new instance of an OS, VM, and/or machine. Avoid headaches by NOT reusing testnet keys, wallets, or databases for your validator.
{% endhint %}

### :unlock: Recommended Security Best Practices

If you need ideas or a reminder on how to secure your staking node, refer to the [security best practices guide](https://www.coincashew.com/coins/overview-eth/guide-or-security-best-practices-for-a-eth2-validator-beaconchain-node).

### :tools: Setup Ubuntu Operating System

If you need to install Ubuntu Server, refer to [this guide.](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-server#1-overview)

Or Ubuntu Desktop, refer to [this guide.](https://www.coincashew.com/coins/overview-xtz/guide-how-to-setup-a-baker/install-ubuntu)

### :performing\_arts: Setup Metamask

If you need to install Metamask, refer to [this guide.](https://www.coincashew.com/wallets/browser-wallets/metamask-ethereum)

### :jigsaw: High Level Validator Node Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
At the end of this guide, you will build a node that hosts three main components in two layers: consensus layer consists of a consensus client, also known as a validator client with a beacon chain client. The execution layer consists of a execution client, formerly a eth1 node.

**Validator client** - Responsible for producing new blocks and attestations in the beacon chain and shard chains.

**Beacon chain client** - Responsible for managing the state of the beacon chain, validator shuffling, and more.

**Execution client (aka Eth1 node)** - Supplies incoming validator deposits from the eth

chain to the beacon chain client.

Note: Teku and Nimbus combines both clients into one process.

## :seedling: 1. Obtain testnet ETH

{% hint style="info" %}
Every 32 ETH you own allows you to make 1 validator. You can run thousands of validators with your beacon node. However on testnet, please only run 1 or 2 validators to keep the activation queue reasonably quick.
{% endhint %}

#### Option 1: Ethstaker's #cheap-goerli-validator Channel

* **Step 1**: Visit the [Ethstaker Discord](https://discord.io/ethstaker) and join the #cheap-goerli-validator channel
* **Step 2**: Use the `/cheap-goerli-deposit` slash command and follow the instructions from the bot. You need to start typing the slash command and it will show above your input box where you can use it.
* **Requirement**: In order to use the cheap goerli validator process, you must now set your withdrawal address to `0x4D496CcC28058B1D74B7a19541663E21154f9c84` when creating your validator keys and deposit file. This is to prevent abuses of this service.

#### Option 2: Watch this how-to [youtube video for Goerli ETH](https://youtu.be/uur7hGCscak)

## :woman\_technologist: 2. Signup to be a validator at the Launchpad

1. Install dependencies, the ethereum foundation deposit tool and generate your two sets of key pairs.

{% hint style="info" %}
Each validator will have two sets of key pairs. A **signing key** and a **withdrawal key.** These keys are derived from a single mnemonic phrase. [Learn more about keys.](https://blog.ethereum.org/2020/05/21/keys/)



You will also set your [ETH Withdrawal Address](https://notes.ethereum.org/@launchpad/withdrawals-faq#Q-What-are-the-two-types-of-withdrawals), preferably from your Ledger or Trezor hardware wallet.
{% endhint %}

You have the choice of using the [Wagyu GUI](https://github.com/stake-house/wagyu-installer), downloading the pre-built [Ethereum staking deposit tool](https://github.com/ethereum/staking-deposit-cli) or building it from source.&#x20;

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Build from source code" %}
Install dependencies.

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip git -y
```



Download source code and install.

```
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/ethereum/staking-deposit-cli
cd staking-deposit-cli
sudo ./deposit.sh install
```



Make a new mnemonic and replace `<ETH_ADDRESS_FROM_IDEALLY_HARDWARE_WALLET>` with your [ethereum withdrawal address](https://notes.ethereum.org/@launchpad/withdrawals-faq#Q-If-I-used---eth1\_withdrawal\_address-when-making-my-initial-deposit-which-type-of-withdrawal-credentials-do-I-have), ideally from a Trezor, Ledger or comparable hardware wallet.

```
./deposit.sh new-mnemonic --chain goerli --eth1_withdrawal_address <ETH_ADDRESS_FROM_IDEALLY_HARDWARE_WALLET>
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Pre-built staking-deposit-cli" %}
Download staking-deposit-cli.

```bash
cd $HOME
wget https://github.com/ethereum/staking-deposit-cli/releases/download/v2.4.0/staking_deposit-cli-ef89710-linux-amd64.tar.gz
```



Verify the SHA256 Checksum matches the checksum on the [releases page](https://github.com/ethereum/staking-deposit-cli/releases/tag/v2.3.0).

```bash
echo "c2b12a9e515f904ca359ec39dfbd7022dfefe881c1796ce42319df0a2da05560 *staking_deposit-cli-76ed782-linux-amd64.tar.gz" | shasum -a 256 --check
```



Example valid output:

> staking\_deposit-cli-ef89710-linux-amd64.tar.gz: OK

{% hint style="danger" %}
Only proceed if the sha256 check passes with **OK**!
{% endhint %}



Extract the archive.

```
tar -xvf staking_deposit-cli-ef89710-linux-amd64.tar.gz
mv staking_deposit-cli-ef89710-linux-amd64 staking-deposit-cli
rm staking_deposit-cli-ef89710-linux-amd64.tar.gz
cd staking-deposit-cli
```



Make a new mnemonic and replace `<ETH_ADDRESS_FROM_IDEALLY_HARDWARE_WALLET>` with your [ethereum withdrawal address](https://notes.ethereum.org/@launchpad/withdrawals-faq#Q-If-I-used---eth1\_withdrawal\_address-when-making-my-initial-deposit-which-type-of-withdrawal-credentials-do-I-have), ideally from a Trezor, Ledger or comparable hardware wallet.

```
./deposit new-mnemonic --chain goerli --eth1_withdrawal_address <ETH_ADDRESS_FROM_IDEALLY_HARDWARE_WALLET>
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Wagyu" %}
Wagyu (formerly known as StakeHouse) is an application aimed at lowering the technical bar to staking on Ethereum 2.0.

Dubbed a 'one-click installer', it provides a clean UI automating the setup and management of all the infrastructure necessary to stake without the user needing to have any technical knowledge.

After creating the validator keys locally, you'll want to copy these validator keys via USB key or rsync file transfer to your staking node.



To align with this guide's steps, first make a default path to store your validator keys.

<pre><code><strong>mkdir -p $HOME/staking-deposit-cli/validator_keys
</strong></code></pre>



If using USB key, mount the key then copy.

```
cp <directory-with-keys>/*.json $HOME/staking-deposit-cli/validator_keys
```



If using rsync, copy your validator keys from your local computer to your staking node with the following command. Change ssh port if needed.

```
rsync -a "ssh -p 22" <directory-with-keys>/*.json <username>@<remote_host>:/home/<username>/staking-deposit-cli/validator_keys
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Advanced - Most Secure" %}
{% hint style="warning" %}
:fire:**\[ Optional ] Pro Security Tip**: Run the staking-deposit-cli tool and generate your **mnemonic seed** for your validator keys on an **air-gapped offline machine booted from usb**.
{% endhint %}



You will learn how to boot up a windows PC into an airgapped [Tails operating system](https://tails.boum.org/index.en.html).

The Tails OS is an _amnesic_ operating system, meaning it will save nothing and _leave no tracks behind_ each time you boot it.



**Part 0 - Prerequisites**

You need:

* 2 storage mediums (can be USB stick, SD cards or external hard drives)
* One of them must be > 8GB
* Windows or Mac computer
* 30 minutes or longer depending on your download speed



**Part 1 - Download Tails OS**

Download the official image from the [Tails website](https://tails.boum.org/install/index.en.html). Might take a while, go grab a coffee.

Make sure you follow the guide on the Tails website to verify your download of Tails.



**Part 2 - Download and install the software to transfer your Tails image on your USB stick**

For Windows, use one of

* [Etcher](https://tails.boum.org/etcher/Etcher-Portable.exe)
* [Win32 Disk Imager](https://win32diskimager.org/#download)
* [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en\_US/)

For Mac, download [Etcher](https://tails.boum.org/etcher/Etcher.dmg)



**Part 3 - Making your bootable USB stick**

Run the above software. This is an example how it looks like on Mac OS with etcher, but other software should be similar.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/etcher\_in\_mac.png)

Select the Tails OS image that you downloaded as the image. Then select the USB stick (the larger one).

Then flash the image to the larger USB stick.



**Part 4 - Download and verify the staking-deposit-cli**

You can refer to the other tab on this guide on how to download and verify the staking-deposit-cli.

Copy the file to the other USB stick.



**Part 5 - Reboot your computer and into Tails OS**

After you have done all the above, you can reboot. If you are connected by a LAN cable to the internet, you can disconnect it manually.

Plug in the USB stick that has your Tails OS.

On Mac, press and hold the Option key immediately upon hearing the startup chime. Release the key after Startup Manager appears.

On Windows, it depends on your computer manufacturer. Usually it is by pressing F1 or F12. If it doesn't work, try googling "Enter boot options menu on \[Insert your PC brand]"

Choose the USB stick that you loaded up with Tails OS to boot into Tails.



**Part 6 - Welcome to Tails OS**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/grub.png)

You can boot with all the default settings.



**Part 7 - Run the staking-deposit-cli**

Plug in your other USB stick with the `staking-deposit-cli` file.

You can then open your command line and navigate into the directory containing the file. Then you can continue the guide from the other tab.



Make a new mnemonic and replace `<ETH_ADDRESS_FROM_IDEALLY_HARDWARE_WALLET>` with your [ethereum withdrawal address](https://notes.ethereum.org/@launchpad/withdrawals-faq#Q-If-I-used---eth1\_withdrawal\_address-when-making-my-initial-deposit-which-type-of-withdrawal-credentials-do-I-have), ideally from a Trezor, Ledger or comparable hardware wallet.

```
./deposit.sh new-mnemonic --chain goerli --eth1_withdrawal_address <ETH_ADDRESS_FROM_IDEALLY_HARDWARE_WALLET>
```



If you ran this command directly from your non-Tails USB stick, the validator keys should stay on it. If it hasn't, copy the directory over to your non-Tails USB stick.



{% hint style="warning" %}
:fire: **Make sure you have saved your validator keys directory in your other USB stick (non Tails OS) before you shutdown Tails. Tails will delete everything saved on it after you shutdown.**.
{% endhint %}



{% hint style="success" %}
:tada: Congrats on learning how to use Tails OS to make an air gapped system. As a bonus, you can reboot into Tails OS again and connect to internet to surf the dark web or clear net safely!
{% endhint %}



Alternatively, follow this [ethstaker.cc](https://ethstaker.cc) exclusive for the low down on making a bootable usb.



**Part 1 - Create a Ubuntu 20.04 USB Bootable Drive**

Video link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTR3PzRRtYU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTR3PzRRtYU)



**Part 2 - Install Ubuntu 20.04 from the USB Drive**

Video link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97\_6MrufCE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97\_6MrufCE)

You can copy via USB key the pre-built staking-deposit-cli binaries from an online machine to an air-gapped offline machine booted from usb. Make sure to disconnect the ethernet cable and/or WIFI.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

2\. If using **staking-deposit-cli**, follow the prompts and pick a **KEYSTORE password**. This password encrypts your keystore files. Write down your mnemonic and keep this safe and **offline**.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Do not send real mainnet ETH during this process!** :octagonal\_sign: Use only goerli ETH.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Caution**: Only deposit the 32 ETH per validator if you are confident your execution client (ETH1 node) and consensus client (ETH2 validator) will be fully synced and ready to perform validator duties. You can return later to launchpad with your deposit-data to finish the next steps.
{% endhint %}

3\. Follow the steps at [https://goerli.launchpad.ethereum.org](https://goerli.launchpad.ethereum.org/en/) while skipping over the steps you already just completed. Study the eth2 phase 0 overview material. Understanding eth2 is the key to success!

{% hint style="info" %}
:whale: **Batch Depositing Tip**: If you have many deposits to make for many validators, consider using [Abyss.finance's eth2depositor tool.](https://abyss.finance/eth2depositor) This greatly improves the deposit experience as multiple deposits can be batched into one transaction, thereby saving gas fees and saving your fingers by minimizing Metamask clicking.

Make sure to switch to **G√ñRLI** network.

Source: [https://twitter.com/AbyssFinance/status/1379732382044069888](https://twitter.com/AbyssFinance/status/1379732382044069888)
{% endhint %}

4\. Back on the launchpad website, upload your`deposit_data-#########.json` found in the `validator_keys` directory.

5\. Connect to the launchpad with your Metamask wallet, review and accept terms. Ensure you're connected to **G√ñRLI** network.

6\. Confirm the transaction(s). There's one deposit transaction of 32 ETH for each validator.

{% hint style="info" %}
For instance, if you want to run 3 validators you will need to have (32 x 3) = 96 goerli ETH plus some extra to cover the gas fees.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Your transaction is sending and depositing your ETH to the goerli ETH2 deposit contract address.

**Check**, _double-check_, _**triple-check**_ that the goerli Eth2 deposit contract address is correct.

[`0xff50ed3d0ec03aC01D4C79aAd74928BFF48a7b2b`](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xff50ed3d0ec03ac01d4c79aad74928bff48a7b2b)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
:fire: **Critical Crypto Reminder:** **Keep your mnemonic, keep your ETH.**

* Write down your mnemonic seed **offline**. _Not email. Not cloud._
* Multiple copies are better. _Best stored in a_ [_metal seed._](https://jlopp.github.io/metal-bitcoin-storage-reviews/)
* Make **offline backups**, such as to a USB key, of your **`validator_keys`** directory.
{% endhint %}

## :flying\_saucer: 3. Install execution client (ETH1 node)

{% hint style="info" %}
Ethereum requires a connection to the execution client in order to monitor for 32 ETH validator deposits. Hosting your own execution client is the best way to maximize decentralization and minimize dependency on third parties such as Infura.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
The subsequent steps assume you have completed the [best practices security guide.](https://www.coincashew.com/coins/overview-eth/guide-or-how-to-setup-a-validator-on-eth2-mainnet/part-i-installation/guide-or-security-best-practices-for-a-eth2-validator-beaconchain-node)

:octagonal\_sign: Do not run your processes as **ROOT** user. :scream:
{% endhint %}

### Create a jwtsecret file

A jwtsecret file contains a hexadecimal string that is passed to both Execution Layer client and Consensus Layer clients, and is used to ensure authenticated communications between both clients.

```bash
#store the jwtsecret file at /secrets
sudo mkdir -p /secrets

#create the jwtsecret file
openssl rand -hex 32 | tr -d "\n" | sudo tee /secrets/jwtsecret

#enable read access
sudo chmod 644 /secrets/jwtsecret
```

### Pick an execution client

Your choice of either [**Geth**](https://geth.ethereum.org)**,** [**Besu**](https://besu.hyperledger.org)**,** [**Nethermind**](https://www.nethermind.io)**, or** [**Erigon**](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon)**.**

{% hint style="info" %}
To strengthen Ethereum's resilience against potential attacks or consensus bugs, it's best practice to run a minority client in order to increase client diversity. Find the latest distribution of execution clients here: [https://clientdiversity.org/](https://clientdiversity.org/)

{% hint style="info" %}
[Lodestar ](https://lodestar.chainsafe.io)**is a Typescript implementation** of the official [Ethereum 2.0 specification](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs) by the [ChainSafe.io](https://lodestar.chainsafe.io) team. In addition to the beacon chain client, the team is also working on 22 packages and libraries. A complete list can be found [here](https://hackmd.io/CcsWTnvRS\_eiLUajr3gi9g). Finally, the Lodestar team is leading the Eth2 space in light client research and development and has received funding from the EF and Moloch DAO for this purpose.

:gear: **4.1 Build Lodestar from source**



Install curl and git.

```bash
sudo apt-get install gcc g++ make git curl -y
```



Install yarn.

```bash
curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install yarn -y
```



Confirm yarn is installed properly.

```bash
yarn --version
# Should output version >= 1.22.4
```



Install nodejs.

```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```



Install and build Lodestar.

```bash
mkdir ~/git
cd ~/git
git clone -b stable https://github.com/chainsafe/lodestar.git
cd lodestar
yarn install --ignore-optional
yarn run build
```



{% hint style="info" %}
This build process may take a few minutes.
{% endhint %}



Verify Lodestar was installed properly by displaying the version.

```
./lodestar --version
```



Setup a directory structure for Lodestar.

```
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/lodestar
sudo chown $USER:$USER /var/lib/lodestar
```



:fire: **4.2. Configure port forwarding and/or firewall**



Specific to your networking setup or cloud provider settings, ensure your validator's firewall ports are open and reachable.



* **Lodestar consensus client** will use port 9000
* **Execution client** requires port 30303



:tophat: **4.3. Import validator key**

```bash
./lodestar validator import \
  --network goerli \
  --dataDir /var/lib/lodestar \
  --keystore $HOME/staking-deposit-cli/validator_keys
```



Enter your **keystore password** to import accounts.



Confirm your keys were imported properly.

```
./lodestar validator list \
  --network goerli  \
  --dataDir /var/lib/lodestar
```



{% hint style="danger" %}
WARNING: Do not import your validator keys into multiple validator clients and run them at the same time, or you might get slashed. If moving validators to a new setup or different validator client, ensure deletion of the previous validator keys before continuing.
{% endhint %}



:snowboarder: **4.4. Start the beacon chain and validator**



Run the beacon chain automatically with systemd.

***

**üõ† Setup systemd service**



Create a **systemd unit file** to define your`beacon-chain.service` configuration.

```
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/beacon-chain.service
```



Paste the following configuration into the file.

```bash
# The eth2 beacon chain service (part of systemd)
# file: /etc/systemd/system/beacon-chain.service

[Unit]
Description=eth2 beacon chain service
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=<USER>
Restart=on-failure
WorkingDirectory=<HOME>/git/lodestar
ExecStart=<HOME>/git/lodestar/lodestar beacon \
  --network goerli \
  --dataDir /var/lib/lodestar \
  --metrics true \
  --checkpointSyncUrl https://goerli.beaconstate.info \
  --jwt-secret /secrets/jwtsecret \
  --execution.urls http://127.0.0.1:8551 \
  --suggestedFeeRecipient 0x_CHANGE_THIS_TO_MY_ETH_FEE_RECIPIENT_ADDRESS

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```



* Replace`0x_CHANGE_THIS_TO_MY_ETH_FEE_RECIPIENT_ADDRESS` with your own Ethereum address that you control. Tips are sent to this address and are immediately spendable, unlike the validator's attestation and block proposal rewards.



To exit and save, press `Ctrl` + `X`, then `Y`, then`Enter`.



Update the configuration file with your current user's home path and user name.

```
sudo sed -i /etc/systemd/system/beacon-chain.service -e "s:<HOME>:${HOME}:g"
sudo sed -i /etc/systemd/system/beacon-chain.service -e "s:<USER>:${USER}:g"
```



Update file permissions.

```bash
sudo chmod 644 /etc/systemd/system/beacon-chain.service
```



Run the following to enable auto-start at boot time and then start your beacon node service.

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable beacon-chain
sudo systemctl start beacon-chain
```



{% hint style="success" %}
Nice work. Your beacon chain is now managed by the reliability and robustness of systemd.
{% endhint %}



:dna: **4.5. Start the validator**



:tools: **Setup systemd service**



Create a **systemd unit file** to define your `validator.service` configuration.

```
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/validator.service
```



Paste the following configuration into the file.

```bash
# The eth2 validator service (part of systemd)

## :track\_next: Next Steps

{% hint style="info" %}
Syncing the consensus client is instantaneous with checkpoint sync but the execution client can take up to 1 week. On high-end machines with gigabit internet, expect your node to be fully syncing to take less than a day.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Patience required**: If you're checking the logs and see any warnings or errors, please be patient as these will normally resolve once both your execution and consensus clients are fully synced to the Ethereum network.\


How do I know I'm fully synced?

* Check your execution client's logs and compare the block number against the most recent block on [https://goerli.etherscan.io/](https://goerli.etherscan.io/)
  * Check EL logs: `journalctl -fu eth1`
* Check your consensus client's logs and compare the slot number against the most recent slot on [https://goerli.beaconcha.in](https://goerli.beaconcha.in/)
  * Check CL logs: `journalctl -fu beacon-chain`
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Once your beacon chain is synced, validator up and running, you just wait for activation. This process can take 24+ hours. Only 900 new validators can join per day. When you're assigned, your validator will begin creating and voting on blocks while earning staking rewards.

Use [https://goerli.beaconcha.in](https://goerli.beaconcha.in/) to create alerts and track your validator's performance.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
:tada: Congrats! You've finished the primary steps of setting up your validator. You're now an Ethereum staker!
