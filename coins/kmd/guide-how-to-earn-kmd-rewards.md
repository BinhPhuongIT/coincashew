## :bar\_chart: 3. How to participate in Komodo's "Active User Rewards"

Komodo pays 0.01% in "Active User Rewards" if you make at least one transaction per month.

To maximize your rewards, every 30 days you will want to send to your own address at least 10 KMD coins.

{% hint style="info" %}
KMD rewards work unlike typical Proof-Of-Stake coins. There is no requirement to leave a wallet open, maintain a node, or be online!
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
:woman\_mage: Tip for the technically-inclined: Komodo's reward is a function of an address **nlocktime** and **UTXO value**.
{% endhint %}
