# Auditing your nodes configuration

To make sure your Cardano nodes (relays and block-producer) are correctly configured, you can use an automated audit script that will do the following checks :

**Cardano Node checks**

- Environment Variables
- Systemd cardano-node file verification and parsing
- Cardano startup script verification and parsing
- Node operation mode (Block Producer ? Relay ?)
- Topology mode
- Topology configuration
- KES keys expiry and rotation alert
  
**Security and system checks**

- SSHD hardening
- Null passwords check
- Important services running
- Firewalling rules extract
- sysctl.conf hardening check

# How to use the Coincashew Cardano Audit Script 

## Download the Audit Script

The script can be found on this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Kirael12/Cardano-Audit-Coincashew) 

You can directly download the repository from your Cardano Nodes :

```bash
cd $HOME/git
git clone https://github.com/Kirael12/Cardano-Audit-Coincashew
```

## Make script executable

```bash
cd $HOME/git/Cardano-Audit-Coincashew
chmod +x audit-coincashew.sh
```
## Run the script

The script must be ran with sudo and the -E option, to include your environnment variables defined during the Coincashew guide (like $NODE_HOME or $NODE_CONFIG)

```bash
sudo -E ./audit-coincashew.sh
```

## Results

It takes 20 seconds for the script to complete. You'll get informations about your node and will immediatly be able to check wether your configuration is good or not, and make appropriate changes
